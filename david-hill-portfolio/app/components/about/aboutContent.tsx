        Hello, I'm David Hill, a self-taught Full Stack Developer from the UK. I
        used to fix bodies as a Sports Therapist, but now I'm all about fixing
        things in the digital world!
      </p>
      <p>
      Every day, I'm thrilled to learn and enhance my web development skills. Shifting my focus entirely to coding, I've set aside my passion for travel. Now, I dive into backend development, solving behind-the-scenes problems, while also refining my front-end skills to create visually appealing and seamless user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm on the lookout for my first job in web development. Eager to
        apply my skills and learn even more, I'm ready for the opportunity that
        will give me that breakthrough. Who's ready to take a chance on a
        passionate and driven developer?
