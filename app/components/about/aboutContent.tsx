        Hi, I’m David Hill — a self-taught IT professional from the UK with a
        passion for technology and problem-solving. I’m exploring different
        areas of IT, including software, web development, and cybersecurity, and
        I’m excited to apply my skills in real-world projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring experience from previous roles where problem-solving, attention
        to detail, and working under pressure were key. Now, I’m focused on
        building a career in IT, learning every day, and taking on challenges
        that help me grow toward a long-term goal in cybersecurity.
