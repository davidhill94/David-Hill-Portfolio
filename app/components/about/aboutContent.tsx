        Hi, I’m David Hill — a self-taught IT professional from the UK with a
        passion for technology and problem-solving. I’m exploring different
        areas of IT, including IT support, web development, and
        cybersecurity. I’m excited to apply my skills to real-world projects
        and practical challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring experience from previous roles where problem-solving, attention
        to detail, and working under pressure were essential. I’m now focused on
        building a career in IT, learning every day, and taking on opportunities
        that help me grow, develop strong technical foundations, and contribute
        effectively in a professional IT environment.
